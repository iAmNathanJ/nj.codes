Ok, I'm calling it. Round one is over. I've emerged victorious in the Express/React/GraphQL/SSR battle of silly hand-rolled blogs. I think I can openly share this little contraption I've precariously propped up before the interwebs. The design still feels a little clunky. I need to get the "light" theme colors in order. I'm not exactly _loving_ it, but it'll do for now. I'm calling this my official-first-new post. Oh, also, I'm using GitHub as a CMS. ðŸ˜¬

Thanks for stopping by. Hit up the [feed](/feed) to stay in my head.
