I'm not one for click-batey titles, but I didn't want you to not read this article... so here we are. I want to share why I think you should consider TypeScript on your next project.

## Contracts Are Everything
This is really the whole thing. The most important aspect of a type system is that it allows you to explicitly define inputs and outputs. The contract of every function signature and return. The contract of any class or object. TypeScript is like tiny contract tests running all over your codebase at all times _while_ you author an app.

There's really no overhead. The TS server runs in the background and gives you real-time feedback _as you write code_. It's an invisible test runner helping to guide you toward program correctness.

## You're Job Can Be Easier
TypeScript is more valuable in a larger codebase.

## This Is The Time
TypeScript is taking off **now**. The community is here. It's been brewing for years, and 2019 looks to be the year that it explodes.
