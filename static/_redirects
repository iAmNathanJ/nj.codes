# NOTES
# ======================================

# The redirects engine will process the first matching rule it finds, reading from top to bottom.

# WHEN TO USE `!`
# By default, you can’t shadow a URL that actually exists within the site when using a splat or dynamic path segment.
# This means that even if you’ve setup the following rewrite rule:
# /*   /index.html   200
# The path /partials/chat.html would still render the contents of that file, if that file actually exists.
# This tends to be the preferred behavior when setting up rewrite rules for single page apps, etc.
# However, if you’re 100% sure that you’ll always want to redirect,
# even when the URL matches a static file, you can append an exclamation mark to the rule:
# /app/*  /app/index.html  200!
# This will rewrite everything within /app/* to /app/index.html even if a file matches the URL.
